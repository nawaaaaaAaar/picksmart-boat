## üìù Development Notes

### Tech Stack for MVP
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS (basic)
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes (keep it simple)
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas + Prisma ORM
- **Auth**: NextAuth.js or simple JWT
- **Payment**: Stripe (easiest to integrate)
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Storage**: Cloudinary or AWS S3 for images

### MVP Development Principles
1. **Functionality over Beauty** - Make it work first
2. **One Feature at a Time** - Complete each fully before moving on
3. **Test Early, Test Often** - Test APIs with Postman before building UI
4. **Keep It Simple** - Avoid over-engineering
5. **Deploy Fast** - Get it online quickly for real-world testing

### Current Priority: Phase 1 - Foundation Setup
**Next Action**: Initialize Next.js project and set up basic structure
